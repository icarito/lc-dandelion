This is my project to make Scratch-like blocks, for use with a variety of programming languages and projects.  It is not intended to be a language / environment the way Scratch is, but to be a library that makes creating Scratch-like environments substantially easier.  I'm using JQuery to handle things behind the scenes.

Progress:

* Basic blocks drawn
* Dragging
* Detecting drop-pointer over drop-target

Next steps:

* Add drop target to bottom of loop
* Get drop working (make droppables conditional as step one)

TODO:

* More color blocks
* If/else blocks
* Expression blocks (numeric and boolean)
* Expression slots
* Drop-down menus in blocks
* Variables
* Beyond Scratch: lists, strings, urls
* Beyond Scratch: more complex arguments to methods
* Beyond Scratch: other container blocks (elif)
* Beyond Scratch: blocks returning values
* Beyond Scratch: user-created blocks
* Beyond Scratch: text-view
* Example project: ScratchBlocks
* Example project: TurtleBlocks
* Example project: ProcessingBlocks
* Example project: SpiroBlocks
* Example project: CardBlocks (Hypercard)
