This is an experimental and example project to see what I can do with dragging (and how easy I can make it) in Cocoa.  There are several projects I want to use the results in:

* Kutia, to drag the turtles
* DrawingBoard, to create selection rectangles
* PyScratch, to create draggable, snappable widgets

Probably a lot more.
